## Building a Custom Blockchain Application with Substrate
### Background
**Blockchains** are distributed ledgers that help securely verify multiparty transactions.  Blockchains have rapidly grown in relevancy and popularity due to both its transparent and secure nature as well as its popular application as a backbone for crypto currencies such as Bitcoin.  Blockchain applications however hold much more potential than for just cryptocurrencies such as smart contracts and voting.

[**Substrate**](https://www.parity.io/substrate/) is a Rust based package for building custom blockchains.  It takes advantage of the WebAssembly (WASM) virtual machine and has many helpful features for creating new blockchain applications.

### Goal
The goal of our project will be to build a custom blockchain application using Substrate.  Potential applications include:
### ---Fill out below---
* Bridge Ethereum’s mainnet to a substrate based network
  * This will…..
* ANOTHER APPLICATION HERE
  * This will…..
We will provide frequent updates as we work on the project’s direction, however the final product should be a novel blockchain application built with Rust and Substrate.

Working on this project will pose unique challenges in taking advantage of Rust to build better blockchains as well as finding ways of best programming blockchains using Rust.  Overall, the project will increase our knowledge and appreciation of both Rust and Blockchains.
